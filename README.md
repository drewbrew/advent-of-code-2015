# Drew's Advent of Code 2015 Solutions

## What is this?

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/20215).

Because I primarily write Python for my day job, I am writing these in Python
for the sake of getting them done. I make no guarantees that these are the
fastest or best solutions, but they work.

## How do I run them?

Download and install Python 3.10 as well as pipenv. Yes, I know Python 3.10 didn't exist in 2015.

Save your day's input as `dayX.txt`, then run `pipenv run python dayX.py`.
